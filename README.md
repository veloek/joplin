# Joplin

A program to generate a [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) note from the command
line.

I used it together with a shellscript which did some of the heavy lifting to get
the input parameters for this program.

This issue
[comment](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/305#issuecomment-373957020)
was my inspiration for the program. 

In the end I went back to Obsidian in favor of Joplin due to some issues I
couldn't live with. Like all the metadata in the note files and that I had to
update the timestamps for the app to recognize a change in the note, and having
an empty line at the end of the file (which I always do) caused a sync error.

Keeping this code around for the next time I visit Joplin if that happens.
